#1Write a program that generates a list L of 50 random numbers between 1 and 100
from random import randint
L =[randint(1,100) for i in range(50)]
print(L)
#2#3
L1=[i**2 for i in L]
print(L1,len([i for i in L if i>50]))
#4
frequenices = [L.count(i) for i in range(1,100)]
print(frequenices)
#Another example
'''The join method can often
be used with list comprehensions
to quickly build up a string.
Here we create a string that contains a random assortment of 1000 letters.'''
from random import choice
alphabet ='qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm'
s =''.join([choice(alphabet) for  i in range(1000)])
print(s)
print('\n')
#One more example
'''Suppose we have a list whose elements are lists of size 2, like below:'''
L =[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
'''If we want to flip the order of the entries in the lists,
we can use the following list comprehension'''
M =[[y,x] for x,y in L]
print(M)

#Note
'''You can certainly get away without using list comprehensions,
but once you get the hang of them,
youâ€™ll find they are both quicker to write and easier to read
than the longer ways of creating lists.'''
